Recon/Enumeration:
------------------

  In this phase you're gathering information about the target.
  Who/What is the target?
  What ports are open?
  What services are running?
  What do those services do?
  What versions are these services?

Look for vulnerabilities:
-------------------------

  This stage will highly depend on the context of the target.
    Is it hosting a web application?
    Is it a domain controller?
    Does it have a file share?
    Do the services running have any known vulnerabilities?
    Does the service running take input? (Can we manipulate this in sone way?)
    

Exploit those vulnerabilities:
